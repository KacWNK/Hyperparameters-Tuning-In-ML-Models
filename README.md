# Hyperparameters Tuning In Machine Learning Models
In this project, we will utilize four distinct datasets to build predictive models aimed at addressing specific problems. Our focus will be on developing and fine-tuning these models using various hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Finally, we will compare the performance of the models to identify the most effective approaches.

# Datasets

### Dataset 1: [Flight Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction)
Dataset contains information about flight booking options from the website Easemytrip for flight travel between India's top 6 metro cities. There are 300261 datapoints and 11 features in the cleaned dataset.

### Dataset 4: [Football Teams Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/football-teams-price-prediction)
Content
The dataset contains 50000 samples, each representing a unique football team. The data is split into 15 numeric columns, 10 categorical columns, and a target column representing the team's market price in billions of dollars. The target prices range from 0.5 billion to 5 billion dollars, reflecting realistic valuations seen in the football industry.
